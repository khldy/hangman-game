Hangman Game
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic "Hangman" word-guessing game. The game dynamically selects a random word from various categories, such as programming languages, movies, historical figures, and countries, and challenges the player to guess it letter by letter. The player has a limited number of wrong attempts before the game ends in a visual hangman representation.

Features
Dynamic Word Categories: Words are randomly picked from predefined categories, making each game unique.
Interactive Gameplay: Players click on letters to guess the word, with real-time feedback for correct and incorrect guesses.
Progressive Hangman Drawing: As the player makes wrong guesses, the hangman drawing progressively appears, adding tension to the game.
Sounds: Audio cues for correct and incorrect guesses enhance the gaming experience.
Game Over Popup: At the end of the game, a popup shows the correct word if the player fails to guess it.
Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the content of the game.
CSS: For styling the layout, including the hangman drawing and letter buttons.
JavaScript: For handling the game logic, random word selection, and user interaction.
